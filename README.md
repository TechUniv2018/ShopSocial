## ShopSocial

### Problem statement

Online shopping is often a solitary activity, unlike shopping in a brick and mortar store, where people have a choice of going shopping together with others. Users have to depend on other social media channels, if at all they try to interact and share their virtual shopping experience.

### Our Solution

Our solution aims to develop a software product which makes online shopping a social activity, where two users share a **common cart** and can interact with each other using a **chat** functionality, while knowing the online activity of each other via events.

### Objective

Our **ShopSocial** e-commerce application aims to provide the following basic features:

- Allow users to add a buddy to **shop together** by sharing their **browsing activities** and share a **common shopping cart**.
- Provide a text-based **chat** option to the user to chat with his/her buddies.
- Allow individual users to **browse, select and order** products on the website.
