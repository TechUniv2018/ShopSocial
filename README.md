# ShopSocial

### Problem statement

Online shopping is often a solitary activity, unlike shopping in a brick and mortar store, where people have a choice of going shopping together with others. Users have to depend on other social media channels, if at all they try to interact and share their virtual shopping experience.

### Our Solution

Our solution aims to develop a software product which makes online shopping a social activity, where two users share a **common cart** and can interact with each other using a **chat** functionality, while knowing the online activity of each other via events.

### Objective

Our **ShopSocial** e-commerce application aims to provide the following basic features:

- Provide an **Admin Console** to allow the site owner to add and remove products from pre-defined lists and manage the inventory.
- Allow users to create an **account** on our portal and browse the products available.
- Allow users to add products to a **shopping cart**, which can be converted to an order on checkout.
- Allow users to add a buddy to share a **common shopping cart**.
- Provide a text-based **chat** option to the user to chat with his/her buddy.
- Allow users to share their **activities** on the web portal to their buddy as events.
